          The Underground started a long time ago. Back in 2018, when I started
          to code, I made a website called Nothing Here, and boy was it
          something. It was a whole one button that linked to my google drive,
          but throughout my years of coding, I learned a few things, and with
          that, I started on a project. I spent years creating what we now know
          and love, The Underground. Without any doubt, this is one of my
          favorite projects, and I never plan on leaving it. So, please enjoy
          what I create, as you tag along on my ride through life.
